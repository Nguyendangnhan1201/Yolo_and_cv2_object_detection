# Yolo_and_cv2_object_detection
A simple object detection project using OpenCV and Yolo model!
## 1. Introduction of OpenCV and Yolo:
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a free and open-source software library designed for computer vision and machine learning tasks. It provides tools to process and analyze visual data, such as images and videos. Developed by Intel and now maintained by the OpenCV Foundation, it's widely used in various applications, including face detection, object tracking, and augmented reality.
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies and classifies objects in images and videos. Unlike traditional methods that process images in multiple steps, YOLO performs detection in a single pass, making it extremely fast and efficient. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring real-time processing, such as surveillance and autonomous vehicles.
## 2. About this repo:
I used Opencv along with YOLO model to make a simple detection of objects.
## 3. Packages to be downloaded: 
- YOLO (you can choose the version as well as its appropriate model from the website of YOLO)
- Ultralytics
- Open CV
  You can download them through pip command in terminal of directly from the websites. I ran the code on VS Code, you may also use an another environment that you are used to. I will also be happy to receive any feedbacks or questions from this repo to get me to know more about coding! Therefore, please feel free to contact me through my Email!
